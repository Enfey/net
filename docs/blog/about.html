            <h1 style="text-align: left;">About This Site</h1>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Hello ! Welcome to this digital estate. <br>
                This site intends to serve a few purposes, so it's had to take on many forms. The phrase 'polymorphic ultimacy' 
                is derived from this. Below the forms this website has taken are detailed:<br> <br> 
                1. <strong>A radio </strong><br>
                At the time of writing, i want to take the radio in the direction of extreme music of varying form. 
                Drone metal, doom metal, black metal, dark ambient, experimental electronic etc are all genres you can come to expect. 
                The first show is planned for the 25th of july, complete with live TouchDesigner visuals. Hopefully you'll enjoy it :)
                <br><br>
                2. <strong>Literature</strong>
                <br>
                A couple of years ago i developed an interest in writing, and I wrote bits and pieces here and there but never really got round to finishing anything.
                Regardless, i'm still somewhat passionate about writing, and i'd like it to belong somewhere other than as a file nobody will see, so I've chosen to archive them here.
                <br><br>
                3. <strong>Sample platform</strong><br>
                I wanted a place to share samples with people effortlessly, and i was already working on the site so it seemed appropriate to bolt the functionality
                onto this virtual body of great disaster you're currently interacting with. Please use them however you like, considering i never finish anything it'd be nice to see
                someone do something with them.
                <br><br>
                4. <strong>Blog</strong><br>
                I make some pretty interesting stuff every now and then, and this'll be the place i document my development processses, and discuss other programming related topics. 
                I imagine this'll move to my portfolio site when i get to work on that, but for now it'll live here. 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left">What now?</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: left">
                This website is not complete. There'll be a few changes visually for mobile users whenever i can get round to implementing them, but in its current form, this website isn't practical to extend
                further, and i'd like to work on other projects that don't involve web development. Later on this year or hopefully early next year there'll be more significant
                additions to the actual feature set of the website. 
                <br><br>
                That's all for now. Thank you for reading :)
