            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Welcome to this digital estate. <br>
                This site intends to serve a few purposes, so it's had to take on a few forms. Below the forms this website has taken are detailed:<br><br>
                1. <strong>A radio </strong><br>
                Deliverance is a radio with an intense focus on extreme music of varying form. Dark ambient, neofolk, power electronics, drone, black metal, sludge metal, 
                experimental electronic etc are all genres you can come to expect. The first show is planned for the 18th of September, complete with live TouchDesigner visuals. If you're
                interested in a radio slot, please <a href="mailto:cleanblessing@protonmail.com">email</a> 
                or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/enfey/">drop a message on Instagram</a>.
                <br><br>
                2. <strong>Literature</strong>
                <br>
                Deliverance is an archive of literary creations. Note: Expect a number of these works to feature branches of mathematics such as 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a>.
                This will require some degree of mathematical literacy, but this isn't strictly necessary to understand the primary content.
                <br><br>
                3. <strong>Sample platform</strong><br>
                Deliverance is a repository of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=chooser-v1">free-to-use</a> samples, of varying theme. 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left">What's coming?</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: left">
                This website is not complete. There'll be a few changes visually for mobile users when in the near future, but in its current form,
                this website isn't practical to extend further. Later on this year/early next year there'll be more significant additions to the actual feature
                set of the website.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for reading :)
