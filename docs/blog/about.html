            <h1 style="text-align: left;">About This Site</h1>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Welcome to this digital estate. <br>
                This site intends to serve a few purposes, so it's had to take on a few forms[1]. Below the forms this website has taken are detailed:<br><br>
                1. <strong>A radio </strong><br>
                Deliverance is a radio with an intense focus on extreme music of varying form. Dark ambient, neofolk, power electronics, drone, black metal, sludge metal, 
                experimental electronic etc are all genres you can come to expect. The first show is planned for 5th August, complete with live TouchDesigner visuals. If you are
                interested in a radio slot, please <a href="mailto:cleanblessing@protonmail.com">email</a> 
                or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/enfey/">message me on Instagram</a>.
                <br><br>
                2. <strong>Literature</strong>
                <br>
                Deliverance is an archive of my personal literary creations. Note: Expect a number of these works to feature branches of mathematics such as 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a>.
                This will require some degree of mathematical literacy, but I wouldn't say this is strictly necessary to understand the primary content.
                <br><br>
                3. <strong>Sample platform</strong><br>
                Deliverance is a repository of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=chooser-v1">free-to-use</a> samples.
                I hope you'll be able to find some use for them. 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left">What's coming?</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: left">
                This website is not complete. There'll be a few changes visually for mobile users when I can get round to implementing them, but in its current form,
                this website isn't practical to extend further. Later on this year/early next year there'll be more significant additions to the actual feature
                set of the website.
                <br><br>
                That's all for now. Thank you for reading :)

            <p style="text-align: left;" id="1">[1] : Just a note on thought generation function. It is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function">injective</a> given that different combinations of sensory inputs and internal state can lead to the same thought. I'm sure you can think of an example for this :)</p><br>
