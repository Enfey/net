                <p style="text-align: left;">
                My abject think-flesh, my sweet skullflower, what a wickedly noetic implement you are! This little thought factory inhabits a blessed vessel, 
                a suit of meaty armour to reify its logical considerations. <br><br></p>
                    
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                How beautiful such a thing is, to produce such fine logic closed under extrinsic abstractions, when it is conceived not knowing of such rules.
                A transformative device, a relentless pursuant of knowledge of the immediate world. A biological whetstone, cyclically eliminating weakness and imperfection.
                Is this not the pinnacle of creation? <br><br></p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                Bask in the brilliance of complication! Though beautiful, the wrinkled material by which our will is writ unto the universe is not flawless.
                The euclidian space upon which the skullflower blooms, <sUp>Râˆž</sUp>, the artificial respite for the polymorphic mind-childs, is tarnished. 
                Frenetic thrall of moral opposition carve out chunks of the expanse with one immaterial hand, and sculpt bricks of black malice with the other.
                This immutable brickwork edifies a torrent of violent reason. As such, the totality of misery endured by humans is on its immaterial hands!
                
                <br><br></p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                I have suffered by it.  Recursive thought, externalised as pangs of obligation, push me deeper into an ocean of 
                volumetric dejection.  Thus the head is a divergent clump of matter. It is neither wholly imperfect nor perfect; it is bitter and sweet, dirty and pure. 
                I neither drown in the ocean nor rise from it. Fathom the permutations of this discord! Inescapable, endless limbo is our sublime prize. <br><br></p>
            
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                For such divinity to be at odds with itself is maddening. We shall try to understand this.   <br><br></p>

        Teetering on the edge of irrevocable oblivion, a broken choir of grief and appetence subjugates the self - a final litany. We will know of no such sentiment.
        Nestled in the brutal embrace of finality, that capricious mind-meat abides an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Unwinding">unwinding of the stack of liquid memory</a>; 
        such that an algorithmic fissiparity evokes the terminal state. For us, convergence on a single, sanative thought in the think-broth is our chosen path. I trust to hold fast this doctrine:

        <br><br>

        'That I am, that I was, that I will be. This is enough. This is my axiom.'<a href="#3">[3]</a>

        <p style="text-align: left;" id="1">[1] : Just a note on thought generation function. It is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function">injective</a> given that different combinations of sensory inputs and internal state can lead to the same thought. I'm sure you can think of an example for this :)</p><br>
