            <h1 style="text-align: left">My Sweet Skullflower</h1>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
            My abject think-flesh, my sweet skullflower, what a wickedly noetic implement you are! This little thought factory inhabits a blessed vessel, 
            a suit of meaty armour to reify its logical considerations. <br><br>

            How beautiful such a thing is, to produce such fine logic closed under extrinsic abstractions, when it is conceived not knowing of such rules.
            An innately transformative device, in relentless pursuit of knowledge of the immediate world it performs biological augments to become the zenith of its kind.
            Is this not the pinnacle of creation? <br><br>

            Bask in the brilliance of complication ! Though beautiful, the wrinkled material by which our will is writ unto the universe is not flawless.
            Our skullflowers make dictators of the weak, seed vile corruption in clean purity, and perpetuate ungodly, self-serving dogma. 
            The totality of misery endured by humans is on its immaterial hands !<br><br>

            I have suffered by it.  Agonising patterns of a recursive disposition, externalised as pangs of obligation, push me deeper into an ocean of 
            volumetric dejection.  Thus the head is a divergent clump of matter. It is neither wholly imperfect nor perfect, it is bitter and sweet, dirty and pure. 
            I neither drown in the ocean nor rise from it. Fathom the permutations of this discord ! Inescapable, endless limbo is our sublime prize. <br><br>

            For such divinity to be at odds with itself is maddening. We shall try to understand this.   <br><br>

            <!--Unfinished
            
            Informally, the set of thoughts can be defined as the amalgamation of innate knowings, the assimilation of the seeds of other skullflowers and 
            local and global extrinsic abstractions, and our delightful dispositions. Its cardinality is infinite; our logic repository is invariably proliferating! <br><br>

            The set of all corporal manifest, is the the amalgamation of possible  expressions, creations and physiological changes.
            Mirroring the proliferation of thought, its cardinality is infinite. 
            eliciting a possible physical manifestation,  should we choose to act on it. <br><br>
            The set of all internal states, is the amalgamation of all possible states of being; 
            it is all possible emotional states, all possible physiological states and all possible states of thought.<br><br>

            A pitiful analogy, i'm sure of it, for to define the head in terms of such a system is  heretical. <br><br>
            -->

            I thank you my sweet, fragile skullflower.  I will wither and wilt and you will be there with me at the very end when our wish to be thawed from mortality is granted, we shall extricate ourselves from our earthly shackles, and become infinite in remembrance. <br><br>

            <p style="text-align: left;" id="1" >1: I would be glad prove the conditions that make the functions surjective, bijective and bijective respectively, but this is (supposedly) a literary piece. To those without a maths background, ie a large number of people, it wouldn't mean terribly much.  </p>
